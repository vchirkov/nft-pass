# Quick Start: Web Verification

To begin NFTs ownership verification you need to have your settings configured on the platform. It can be done in less
than 5 minutes using [this guide](./dev-center.md). Please consider reading it first.

Assuming you have all set, we can proceed with integrating with your Application.

## Installation

To have access to client side library, you can install package with npm or yarn.

```bash
npm i @nft-pass/client
```

```bash
yarn add @nft-pass/client
```

After package is installed, you can use `NFTPass` module like this:

```jsx
// commonjs
const NFTPass = require('@nft-pass/client');
```

```jsx
// es6
import NFTPass from '@nft-pass/client';
```

```html
<!--Web-->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@nft-pass/client"></script>
<script>
    console.log(NFTPass)
</script>
```

## Usage

To check if wallet owns nfts that match address(es), that you added on the platform, simply call `verify` method and
pass the corresponding parameters:

```jsx
NFTPass.verify({apiKey})
    .then(data => {
        // ...
    })
    .catch(console.error);

```

The one required parameter is the `apiKey` and it can be copied from the configuration
created [here](http://devcenter.nft-pass.net/).

### Optional arguments:

`message` - text for signing in the wallet (has default value)
`jwt` - json web token, generated by `authentication` method. If passed, will skip message signing by the wallet

### Response Value:

```tsx
type NFTPassVerifyData = {
    /**
     * if there are matching nfts for the selected wallet on configured network
     */
    match: boolean,
    /**
     * which network was used for nfts search
     */
    network: string,
    /**
     *  list of NFTS, owned by the wallet, that matched Application configuration
     */
    nfts: NFTResult[]
}
```

with the following nft result schema:

```tsx
interface NFTResult {
    amount: number;
    contract_type: 'ERC721' | 'ERC1155';
    name: string | null;
    symbol: string | null;
    token_address: string;
    token_id: string;
    token_uri: string | null;
}
```

`match` property identifies, that there were NFTs matching configuration (will be `true` if there were one or multiple
NFTs).

`network` identifies, which network did NFTPass search against.

`nfts` is the list of matching NFT items for the configuration set.
