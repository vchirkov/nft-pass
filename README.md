# NFTPass

> Non Fungible Tokens are a proof for a digital ownership. This ownership can be used to give access to any digital and physical resource, service or premise.

NFTPass enables organisations to implement information access controls and privileges based on NFT ownership. It ensures
only authorised individuals have access to the right data at the right time and for the right reasons.

The access mechanism is organised organised does not involve access to sensitive data and does not store any, making
identity management completely anonymous and secure.
